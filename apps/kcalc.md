 - Trigonometric functions, logic operations and statistical calculations
 - A results stack which enables convenient recall of previous calculation results
 - Precision is user-definable
 - The display allows cut and paste of numbers
 - The display colors and font are configurable, aiding usability
 - The use of key-bindings make it easy to use without a pointing device
 
 This tool is part of the KDE Utils Suite.
